      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! This is something new that I am trying out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking to write and share blog posts here about the books I am reading, the things I am learning while doing my MBA at Dalhousie, and anything else I find interesting or exciting in the world of business and in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog initiated a new design of my website. My old website was something I built from scratch. My old website was built using PUG and SASS and I had built an easy development environment using GULP and BrowserSync. This website was great, but when looking into how I wanted to integrate a blog, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo allows for this easy development environment while allowing for a simple blog environment. Rather than just build my blog with Hugo and integrate that into my old site, I thought it would be better to learn a new framework and develop something new. So welcome! I hope this blog will be interesting and or thought provoking to those who read it. I appreciate any feedback you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nic&lt;/p&gt;
